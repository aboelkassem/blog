Hi there <!--StartFragment-->üëãüèª<!--EndFragment-->! \
My name is **[Mohamed Abdelrahman](https://www.aboelkassem.tech)** and this is **my personal blog** in which I write tech notes and articles mostly related to .Net Technology, web development and other related software topics. I am currently working with Angular and ASP.NET Core, so those are most likely the topics I will be covering here, because I do like working with it and I've been doing it for quite a while. Hope you find the content here valuable.

This aims to be a place where I can publish anything and everything that interests me. Mostly about science, technology, programming and graphics.

This is a place where I want to share the challenges that I have faced. I will also show you how I overcame them so that others, who may be going through the same, won‚Äôt have to go through them alone. It‚Äôll also be a place where i can rant about things that bother me.

I hope this blog helps and inspires people to overcome their challenges, learn new things and make their lives better.

As they say, life's a journey and I want us to support each other through each passing day.
